# Ticket System
    Programming Language : Python
    Framework : Django

# What is it?
    This is a ticketing system operating using queue style organization. The goal is to create a simple software that customer service and developers can use to recieve complaints/feedbacks from users of some form of software. 

# How to compile it?
    This project will be compiled via an IDE in order to launch the server it is connected to.

# How to run it? 
    The system will be run behind the scenes and accessed through an admin portion of the website it is built for. This way it's modular and can be accessed by any admin in order for the spread of ticket management.
